## Contributing

**General Rules**

- As much as possible, try to follow the existing format of markdown and code.
- Don't forget to run the files in Xcode before submitting pull requests.
- Make sure that **100%** of your code is covered by tests.


**Contributing New Files**

- Make your pull requests to be **specific** and **focused**. Instead of 
contributing "more than 2 files" all at once contribute them all 
one by one separately (i.e. one pull request for "struct ContentView", another one
for "struct BrowserWebView" and so on).
- Describe and explain what you do in code using **comments**.
